Resource Generation Relationship
(Assume 1 per second for sake of understanding as a base rate)

Wood: Standard Rate 1/second
Might increase over time with upgrades. (Eg. each upgrade adds 0.1/second OR 10% increase)

Honey: Lower Standard Rate 0.5/second
Rate increases with each upgrade (eg. +0.2/second OR 20% increase)
Having the flowers in the field/farm would increase rate by 50%

Silk: Lowest Standard Rate 0.25/second
Rate increased with each updrade (e.g. +0.1/second OR 10% increase (depending on the rate we're after, or see below)
Having mulberry in the field/farm would increase rate by 50%


Alternatively, each rate for upgrades is standardised, and the only thing that changes is the base standard rate (and would work on a percentage model)
In this case:
Wood: 1/second (increases by 10% each upgrade (regardless of where it is made)
Honey: 0.5/second (increases by 20% each upgrade in the Beehive)
Silk: 0.25/second (increases by 20% each upgrade in the Silkworm Den) (the 10% from above would be if we wanted the increase to be slower (and if using integers))

Both the Honey and Silk increase by 50% when a plot in the farm/field is filled with their chosen plant, so the Honey production could be doubled if both plots were filled with flowers (50% + 50%)

I imagine the increases would be additive rather than compunded(?) (We add percentages rather than using a percentage on the numbers that have already got a percentage applied) (Eg. 100 + 50% (of 100) = 150, then if another percentage was applied, it would be taken from the base (100 + 50% + 10% = 100 + 50 + 10 = 160). I hope this is understandable. However if the opposite is easier, then that's fine too.

Instead it could be entirely integer based, where the value is increased by set numbers, but I felt a percentage might be easier to work with.

As for any interactions between the characters, I'm not sure how applicable this is, especially if it changes based on where the character appears each time you load it, so I feel we can at least start with this.
